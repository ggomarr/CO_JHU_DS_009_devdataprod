## The Shiniest App

On top of a data freak, I am a fitness freak.

The purpose of the app is to help me determine which number of days window length produces the most meaningful average when exploring the rolling average number of steps taken, as measured by the FitBit strapped to my wrist. The length of the window can be selected on the panel to the left of the app.

On top of a fitness freak, I am a diving freak.

Good as it is, I cannot take my FitBit with me while diving. The diving days therefore heavily bias the result. They can be ignored in the calculation of the rolling average by clicking the checkbox on the panel to the left of the app.

The app is reachable here: [https://ggomarr.shinyapps.io/FitBit] (https://ggomarr.shinyapps.io/FitBit)
